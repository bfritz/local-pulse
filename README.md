# Local Pulse

Use the GitHub API to find all recently created projects from users in a geographic area.

To run, simply call `rake` -> on first run it will ask you for your GitHub username and password, along with what geographic areas you would like to search, and store them in ".env" in the local directory. Then, to view the webpage, simply run `ruby app.rb` and then go to localhost:4567.
